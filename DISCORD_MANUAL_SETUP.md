# Discord Manual Setup Guide ðŸŽ®

## What You Need to Do Manually

### 1. Get Your Discord Server ID

   - Open Discord â†’ Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Enable Developer Mode

2. **Get Server ID**:
   - Right-click your server name â†’ Copy Server ID
   - Update `.env.local`: `DISCORD_GUILD_ID=YOUR_SERVER_ID_HERE`

### 2. Invite Bot to Your Server
1. **Create Invite Link**:
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1408720511571066903&permissions=268445712&scope=bot
   ```
   *(Replace client_id with your bot's ID if different)*

2. **Required Permissions**:
   - âœ… Manage Channels
   - âœ… Manage Roles  
   - âœ… Send Messages
   - âœ… Read Message History
   - âœ… Use External Emojis
   - âœ… Embed Links

### 3. Server Structure Setup
Create these channels manually:

#### Basic Channels:
```
ðŸ“‹ GENERAL
â”œâ”€â”€ #welcome
â”œâ”€â”€ #announcements  
â””â”€â”€ #notifications (for admin alerts)
```

#### Voice Channels for Premium Sessions:
```
ðŸŽ¯ COACHING
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŽ¤ Premium Session 1
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŽ¤ Premium Session 2
â””â”€â”€ ðŸŽ¤ Premium+ Session
```

**Note**: Customer channels are auto-created by the bot!

### 4. Calendly Links Setup
Update these links in `lib/discord/bot.ts`:

```typescript
// Line ~135 - Premium Plan
value: '**[ðŸ“… Click here to book your session](https://calendly.com/YOUR-CALENDLY-LINK/1h-coaching)**'

// Line ~160 - Premium+ Plan  
value: '**[ðŸ“… Click here to book your premium session](https://calendly.com/YOUR-CALENDLY-LINK/1h30-premium-coaching)**'
```

### 5. Optional: Upload Storm Icon
1. Upload a storm/lightning icon to Discord
2. Copy the image URL
3. Update `lib/discord/bot.ts` line ~120:
   ```typescript
   .setThumbnail('YOUR_STORM_ICON_URL_HERE')
   ```

### 6. Testing the Bot
1. **Deploy your app** to Vercel with new environment variables
2. **Test payment flow**:
   - Make test purchase â†’ Check if channel is created
   - Verify customer gets proper instructions
   - Check if you receive admin notifications

### 7. Production Considerations

#### Security:
- âœ… Keep bot token secret
- âœ… Regularly rotate tokens
- âœ… Monitor bot activity logs

#### Scaling:
- Current setup uses `setTimeout` for channel deletion
- For production, consider using:
  - **Bull Queue** for job scheduling
  - **Database** to track channel lifecycles
  - **Cron jobs** for cleanup

#### Customer Support:
- Monitor `#notifications` channel for new customers
- Respond to customer uploads in private channels
- Use Discord's search to find customer conversations

### 8. What Happens Automatically âœ¨

After setup, the bot will:

1. **Payment Success** â†’ **Private Channel Created**
2. **Welcome Message** â†’ **Plan-Specific Instructions** 
3. **Admin Notification** â†’ **Customer Details Sent to You**
4. **Auto-Cleanup** â†’ **Channel Deletes After Period**

### Troubleshooting

#### Bot Not Creating Channels:
- Check `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` is correct
- Verify bot has permissions
- Check Vercel logs for errors

#### Bot Not Responding:
- Bot needs to be online (Vercel keeps it alive)
- Check Discord Developer Portal for status
- Verify webhook is receiving events

#### Missing Admin Notifications:
- Create `#notifications` channel
- Bot will auto-find it by name
